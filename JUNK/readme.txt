I generally have a mass of resources which are needed for a site build but don’t form part of the live website files. For example:

•	Photoshop PSD files used to creat the individual graphics
•	Word documents with content for pages
•	Large JPEG’s

My approach is to file all this content in the _JUNK folder so that it is handy.

There is a robots.txt file associated with the ‘Starter-Pack’ it has an exclusion for the ‘_JUNK’ folder. I have done this is mainly to illustrate an example for the correct syntax should I want to ask search engines not to visit a directory but it also serves just in case the ‘_JUNK’ folder is uploaded by mistake.
